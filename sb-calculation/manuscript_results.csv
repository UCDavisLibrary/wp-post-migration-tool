He came to California in 1938 at the invitation of Georges de Latour, owner of Beaulieu Vineyard, who was seeking a winemaker who could bring European methods to his winery. During his time at Beaulieu, Tchelistcheff introduced the now standard practices of fermenting white wines in a cold room and using malolactic fermentation as an essential part of making red wines. Tchelistcheff remained at Beaulieu until his retirement in 1973, after which he worked as a consulting enologist for many winemakers and wineries, including Robert Mondavi, Louis M. Martini, Franciscan Vineyards, Firestone, Jordan, and Buena Vista in California, and Chateau Ste. Michelle in Washington. Following retirement, Tchelistcheff also conducted a series of tours for winemakers through Wine Tours International, the first of which coincided with the famous 1976 Paris Tasting. In 1991, Tchelistcheff returned to Beaulieu as a consultant and worked there until his death in 1994.","Scrapbooks, photograph albums, clippings, awards, memorabilia, and papers curated by Dorothy Tchelistcheff, wife of André Tchelistcheff.

The business helped to pioneer growing techniques in the rice industry including sowing seed with airplanes. Keisaburo Koda was the founder of the present day Koda Farms. He was born in 1882 in Ogawa, Japan. Due to his success he was widely known amongst Japanese Americans as the &quot;rice king.&quot; During World War II the family was placed in Jerome Relocation Center in Arkansas and at the end of the war transferred to the Granada Relocation Center in Colorado. This was even though the U.S. government ordered that the business be kept running to produce food and fiber. The company was managed by strangers, until the family was released and able to come back to claim their business. Keisaburo's sons, Edward and William &quot;Bill,&quot; took over building the business in the post war years, becoming the first commercial growers of sweet rice marketing Sho-Chiku-Bai Sweet Rice andMochiko Blue Star Brand Sweet Rice Flour. They also developed a unique variety of rice called Kokuho Rose. In 1977 Bill Koda sold his share of the business to his brother Edward and was no longer involved in the Koda Family Farm. Today Koda Farm is operated by Edward Koda's direct descendants. The Koda Family Papers are the papers of Bill Koda and his wife, Jean (Morimoto) Koda.","Family photograph albums, 16 mm films, correspondence, newspaper clippings, and notebooks",D-474,1930-1970.,5,linear feet,,,,,,False,[{'href': 'https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/manuscript/10743'}],[{'href': 'https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/manuscript'}],[{'href': 'https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/types/manuscript'}],[{'href': 'https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=10743'}],"[{'taxonomy': 'post_tag', 'embeddable': True, 'href': 'https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=10743'}]","[{'name': 'wp', 'href': 'https://api.w.org/{rel}', 'templated': True}]",

Pierce, Jr. He is especially known for playing a significant role in the founding of the University of California, Davis by energetically campaigning to have the University Farm located in his hometown of Davisville. Records relating to the selection of Davis as the site for the University Farm as well as records relating to the purchase of land and water rights for the farm can be found in this collection.
