Pierce, Sr.; Eunice Pierce; George W. Pierce, Jr.; Susan Gilmore Pierce; George Gardner Pierce; Dixwell Lloyd Pierce; The Pierce Family; and Photographs. Series named for individuals contain items created or collected by that individual family member. The series titled, The Pierce Family, is made up of items not attributed to just one family member or items that cannot be identified as belonging to any certain family member. The Photographs series consists of photographs (1878-1929) of the Pierce Family; Yolo County and Sacramento Valley sites; agricultural activities on the Pierce Ranch near Davisville and other Yolo County locations; the California Almond Growers&#39; Exchange; the University of California; and other topics. The bulk of the records in this collection are those of George W. Pierce, Jr. He is especially known for playing a significant role in the founding of the University of California, Davis by energetically campaigning to have the University Farm located in his hometown of Davisville. Records relating to the selection of Davis as the site for the University Farm as well as records relating to the purchase of land and water rights for the farm can be found in this collection. Many types of materials make up the Pierce Family Papers including correspondence, legal documents, financial records, diaries, printed material, artifacts, creative works, notes, travel guides and brochures, and photographs. The numerous diaries included in the Pierce Family Papers are a particularly rich source of information for researchers of any number of topics such as late nineteenth and early twentieth century agriculture; labor issues; Yolo County and California history; the almond growing industry; and the history of the University of California."
